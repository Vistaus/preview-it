# preview-it

A KDE Dolphin Service Menu, that let's you toggle between preview and no preview view
in any folder. it is basicly the same as View -> Show Previews in regular toolbar, 
which is for reasons no longer the default and is not easily available via the
hamburger menu. if you often wanna switch between view modes and like hamburger
menu better than the regular toolbar, this is for you.
